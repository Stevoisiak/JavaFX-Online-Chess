# JavaFX-Online-Chess [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Stevoisiak/JavaFX-Online-Chess.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Stevoisiak/JavaFX-Online-Chess)
Simple chess program written in JavaFX. Note that by default this program uses localhost for multiplayer.

## Feature List

* Fully functional chessboard GUI
* Movable chess piece objects with team-colored piece images
* Game board drawn differently for white/black
* Supports 2 player online games
  * Game board is frozen while waiting for opponent's move
* Offline mode for local play
* Unique piece movement for King, Queen, Rook, Bishop, Knight, and Pawn
  * Pawns restricted to one-way movement
* Chat area for messages between players
* Both client & server validate moves before updating board
* Licensed for reuse under MIT License
* Customizable board colors via stylesheet.css

## Missing Features

* Special pawn rules (Piece promotion, en passant, only capture diagonally, situational 2 space movement, etc)
* Indicators for check, checkmate, and stalemate
* Handling for edge case where client & server disagree on whether a move is valid
* Allow castling

## Bugs

* Queens, Rooks, and Bishops can move past occupied spaces
* GameBoard can be interacted with before client-server connection is established

## Edge Cases

* If the client cannot find a server (ie: client started before server), chatbox displays "Error: Failed to connect to server"
* Players cannot capture their own pieces. Clicking on a piece of the same color will update the currently selected piece

## Future plans

* When a piece is selected, hightlight spaces it can move to
* Implement check, checkmate, & stalemate
* Add ability to surrender
* Option to start a new game without closing connection
* Switch project to public on GitHub
* Add indicator showing which player's turn it is
